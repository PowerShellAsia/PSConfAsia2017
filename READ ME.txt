Raspberry Pi setup using Windows 10 IoT core reference - https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/getstarted

Connection Setup Once your Windows 10 IoT core is installed on the Raspberry Pi as per the PPT, copy the PowerPiLib.dll on to the Raspberry Pi. 
Connect the positive side of your LED to GPIO 5 pin or Physical pin 29 and the negative side to the ground (GND) pin or Physical pin 1. 

For setup, load the PowerPiLib.dll in WinIoT powershell console (accessed via Powershell Remoting). 
PowerPiLib.dll is generated from the C# solution. Code is placed in PowerPiApp.zip folder.

DEMO Powershell commands 

#To initiate Powershell remoting, use the below commands 
net start WinRM 
Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\client\TrustedHosts -Value Enter-PSSession –ComputerName -Credential 

#Password prompt will appear. Enter the password.

#Loading the DLL 
Add-Type -Path .\PowerPiLib.dll 
$ioValue = New-Object PowerPiLib.GpioValue 
$ioHelper = New-Object PowerPiLib.GpioHelper

#To turn off LED: 
$ioHelper.Pin = $ioValue::High

#To turn on LED: 
$ioHelper.Pin = $ioValue::Low

#To blink every 1 second 
while($true) 
{ $ioHelper.Pin = @{$true=$ioValue::Low;$false=$ioValue::High}[$ioHelper.Pin -eq $ioValue::High]
start-sleep -m 1000 
}
