# PowerShell Conference Asia 2017
PowerShell is fast becoming an essential tool in DevOps toolchains as it continues on its mission to empower the administration of Any Cloud, on Any Platform, from Any Device.

The PowerShell Conference Asia resumes for its 3rd year this October, bringing speakers from Asia and around the world to deliver in-depth PowerShell and DevOps sessions. Speakers include the Microsoft PowerShell Product Team from headquarters in Redmond and a strong line-up of MVPs, well-known international speakers, and community contributors.

They'll cover in-depth topics on the PowerShell language and how you can use PowerShell to automate the technologies you use every day, both within the Microsoft technology stack and well beyond. There will be strong focus on using PowerShell to enable DevOps practices whether On Premises or in the cloud as well as Systems Administration and Security. Our theme for this year will emphasise on the Open Source aspects of PowerShell development as we look to build an even stronger community engagement and contribution.
